### forcefield_ona: A foyer forcefield for mbuild_ona model
 * This forcefield is for the mbuild topology created by mbuild_ona (github.com/zijiewu3/mbuild_ona), a coarse-grained ONA model created within MoSDeF framework. 

 * Source: A.F. Ghobadi and A. Jayaraman, Soft Matter (2016), 12, 8, 2276-2287. DOI: 10.1039/C5SM02868J 

 * Forcefield file initially created April 30 by Z. Wu.

#### Additional Notes:
Due to the limitation of foyer's application, care needs to be given that all units in a written-out .top file is, regardless of the indicated units in file, in reduced unit.
The write_to_lammps method in mbuild is able to handle the reduced unites ('lj unit') correctly given the appropriate arguments.
